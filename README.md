🔧 Configuration
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory:

env
SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_key_here
INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_key_here
Network Configuration
The project supports multiple networks:

localhost: Local development network

sepolia: Ethereum testnet

mainnet: Ethereum mainnet (use with caution)

🚀 Usage
Creating a Proposal
Connect your wallet

Navigate to "Create Proposal" tab

Enter proposal title and description

Submit transaction and wait for confirmation

Voting on Proposals
Browse active proposals in the main dashboard

Click "Vote For" or "Vote Against"

Confirm the transaction in MetaMask

See real-time vote updates

Closing Proposals
Proposal creators can close their own active proposals

Closed proposals show final vote results

No further voting allowed on closed proposals

🧪 Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite:

bash
# Run all tests
npx hardhat test

# Run only Solidity tests
npx hardhat test solidity

# Run only TypeScript tests
npx hardhat test mocha

# Run tests with coverage
npx hardhat coverage
📡 Deployment
Deploy to Sepolia Testnet
bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy --network sepolia ignition/modules/DAO.ts
Deploy to Mainnet
bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy --network mainnet ignition/modules/DAO.ts
